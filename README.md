## Chemify Code Submission

Hi there! 😁

Thanks for taking the time to review my submission. I took the AI-first approach with Claude to see how much it can achieve in a short space of time. 
I've decided to stop here and submit what I have. I have not completed all the bonus bits, but I am happy to chat over how I would approach that face-to-face.

### Backend

In the backend Claude's first approach worked pretty well. I asked it to use the Hexagonal architecture, as I am interested in the topic and want to give it a go. 
I also decided to go for SQLAlchemy as it's an opportunity to learn more about it. Only a small subset of unit tests was added for the services. 

### Frontend

The first frontend concept from the prompt was not great. I had to (with Claude) make a lot of changes to get it structured in a way that I was happy with. The 
frontend UI/UX was also generated by Claude.ai. I gave an initial description of what I wanted and then asked for it to change things I didn't like.

### Conclusion

I fully expect to be challenged on what's in this repository, and I welcome it, especially because Claude was the heavy lifter here. I have definitely learnt a thing
or two and refreshed my knowledge a bit in the frontend.

Happy coding!
