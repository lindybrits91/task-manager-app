Build me a REST API backend application that adheres to the Hexagonal architecture pattern with the following requirements:

Tech Stack:
- Python (latest) with FastAPI
- PostgreSQL database
- SQLAlchemy for the ORM and database migrations

Features:
- CRUD operations for a "tasks" resource with fields: id, description, status, user_id, created_at, updated_at (status can be only one of three — "TODO", "DOING" or "DONE")
- A user resource with fields: id, username, created_at (no CRUD operations required for initial setup)
- Input validation
- Environment variable configuration

Database Setup:
- Create a Postgres database schema with users and tasks tables
- Set up migration scripts
- Include seed data for testing
- Do not containerize for the first version

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/tasks - Create task
- PUT /api/tasks/:id - Update task
- GET /api/tasks - Get tasks by user_id
- DELETE /api/tasks/:id - Delete task

Additional Requirements:
- Include a README with setup instructions
- Add a .env.example file
- Use standard pip/venv for dependency management
- Write the code in the Pythonic way

Please set up the project structure, implement all endpoints, and ensure the database connection is properly configured.
